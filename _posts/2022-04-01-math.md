Have you ever wanted to do some real nice blogging but with some math? Evidently I have. Let's try to see if we can find something that can do the math and the blogging. More importantly, let's see if we can figure out what works and what doesn't.

## Inline Math

Here are some words that surround $$f(x)$$ and some on this side too. Will this appear inline? What about if we try $f(x)$ like this? Who knows really.

What about if I try something like this:
$$f(x)$$

Or better yet:

$$g(x)$$

Now what if we were to try something such as:
\begin{equation}
	y = f(x)
\end{equation}

Stay tuned people.
