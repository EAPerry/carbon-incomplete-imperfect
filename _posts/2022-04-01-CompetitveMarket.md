title: A Model of Competitive Generation

---

The model of perfectly competitive generation follows closely from [Fowlie, Petersen, and Reguant (2021)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211073). In a scenario with perfectly competitive generation, the resulting allocation uniquely maximizes welfare. Using this fact, we look for the generation that will maximize the sum of total welfare in each market. Let $$q_{ir}$$ be the power generation of plant $i$ for region $$r$$. Note here that plant $$i$$ is not necessarily located in region $$r$$, but that it generates this power to be sold in region $$r$$â€™s wholesale (day-ahead) market. 

## Setting up the objective function

We assume that demand for power in these wholesale markets is linear. Specifically, the inverse demand function for region $$r$$ at time $$t$$ is,

$$p_{rt} = \alpha_{rt} - \beta_{rt} Q_{rt},$$

where $$p_{rt}$$ and $$Q_{rt}$$ are the price and quantity demanded in the market. In equilibrium, the quantity demanded must equal the quantity supplied. That is, 

$$Q_{rt} = \sum_{i \in N} q_{ir}.$$

Total surplus in the markets is the sum of the area under the demand curves from each market minus the sum of all marginal costs. Then the sum of the area under the demand curves in each market is

$$\sum_{r \in R} \left[ \frac{1}{2}\left( 2\alpha_{rt} - \beta_{rt} \sum_{i \in N} q_{ir}\right) \sum_{i \in N} q_{ir} \right]$$

Let $$mc_i$$ be the marginal cost plant $$i$$ faces. Then the area under the supply curve (in the absence of a carbon tax and border carbon adjustment) is

$$\sum_{i \in N} \left( mc_i  \sum_{r \in R} q_{ir} \right).$$

Power plants may incur additional costs with the implementation of a carbon tax, or costs with the implementation of a border carbon adjustment. Let $$\tau$$ be the tax paid on one ton of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Let $$e_i$$ be the emissions intensity of plant $$i$$. With a border carbon adjustment though, plants outside of California may or may not pay the tax based on their emissions intensity. Denote the assessed emissions intensity of a plant (located outside of California) as $$\tilde{e_i}$$. Then the sum of all variable costs from emissions taxes is

$$\left(\sum_{i \in \text{California}} \left(\tau e_i \sum_{r \in R} q_{ir}\right)\right) + \left(\sum_{i \not\in \text{California}} \tau \tilde{e_i} q_{i, \text{California}} \right).$$
