## About the Project

This project began as an end-of-the-semeseter project for an independent study I took titled "Game Theory and the Environment" in fall 2021. Since then, I have revisited it occasionally, trying to update and build on the methodolgy and data. 

The content of the project itself is heavily influenced by [Fowlie, Petersen, and Reguant (2021)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211073).
This project attempts to exapnd on their work by introducing models that do not rely on perfectly competitive markets. I seek to analyze the role of uniform and differentiated border carbon adjusments in the face of a variety of market power structures.
